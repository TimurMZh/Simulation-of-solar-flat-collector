# Simulation-of-solar-flat-collector

## Description

This library provides a simulation of a flat solar collector for the water heating system with the Kazakhstan climate condition. The simulation of the solar heating system is done in Matlab (Simulink). The solar system is simulated by the mathematical model (ODE model) of energy.

## Example
Numerical simulations were conducted for different examples such as one year, 3, and 9 days data.
